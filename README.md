# BitcartCC Plugins Collection

This repository contains source code for official plugins maintained by BitcartCC. It does not contain the plugin archives themselves, they are distributed via plugin registry.

# Plugins list:

- Lightning Network + - connect to your external pre-setup lightning node instead of BitcartCC's built-in electrum one. (currently only LNDHub is supported)
- Daemons RPC Plugin - exposes daemons RPC to Merchants API (via `server_management` scope) and adds a nice interactive daemons shell
- Ratings plugin - adds ability for customers to rate products on store POS via a simple 5-star system
